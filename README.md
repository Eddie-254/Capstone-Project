## 1. Business Understanding
### Overview
The healthcare fraud detection capstone project aims to develop a robust system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks, along with anomaly detection techniques like clustering, outlier detection, and support vector machines. These algorithms will be applied to integrated healthcare data to accurately identify and flag potential fraudulent activities in healthcare claims. 

The project will involve preprocessing and integrating diverse data sources, extracting relevant features, training the models on historical data with known fraudulent and non-fraudulent instances, and optimizing the system for scalability. The interpretability of results will be emphasized to provide transparent and understandable outputs, facilitating decision-making processes. Ultimately, the project seeks to combat healthcare fraud, minimize financial losses, improve patient care, and enhance the integrity of the healthcare industry.

### Problem Statement
Healthcare fraud has grown to be a major problem on a global scale, costing both public and private healthcare organizations huge sums of money. Fraudulent practices include billing for treatments that were never provided, receiving kickbacks, and identity theft not only waste money but also jeopardize patient care and public confidence in the healthcare system. For the sake of maintaining fiscal integrity, fair and accurate invoicing, and the caliber of healthcare services, it is crucial to identify and stop healthcare fraud.
### Objectives

#### Main objective:
To develop an effective healthcare fraud detection system to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in the healthcare industry.

#### Specific objectives:

*Identify Fraudulent Patterns:* The main goal of the analysis of healthcare data is to spot patterns and 1. behaviors of fraud. Investigating the data is necessary to find anomalies, strange patterns, and irregularities that could point to fraudulent activity.

*Provide Actionable Insights:* The goal is to produce warnings and actionable insights that may be used for additional research and intervention. The system should deliver concise and enlightening reports, to help fraud analysts and investigators take the proper measures in response to the identified fraudulent practices.

*Develop a robust system for healthcare fraud detection:* The primary objective of the project is to create a highly effective and reliable system for detecting healthcare fraud that will accurately identify and flag potential instances of fraudulent activities in healthcare claims.

*Facilitate decision-making processes related to fraud detection:* To assist the decision-makers in the healthcare industry with the necessary tools and information to combat fraud effectively in order to identify and investigate potential fraudulent activities.
