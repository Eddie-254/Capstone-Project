<h1><u><b>Healthcare Fraud Detection Analysis<b></u></h1>

<img src="medicare-1 fraud.png" />

<p>This project aims to develop a robust system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and flag potential fraudulent activities in healthcare claims.</p>


## Project Description
This project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to train models that can identify fraudulent healthcare claims. The models are trained on a dataset of historical healthcare claims data and publicly available data sources. The models are evaluated on their ability to identify fraudulent claims, and the performance of the models is reported using a variety of metrics.

## Project Goals
The goals of this project are to:
<ul>
<li>Develop a robust system for detecting healthcare fraud</li>
<li>Identify fraudulent patterns in healthcare data</li>
<li>Provide actionable insights that can be used to prevent fraud</li>
<li>Facilitate decision-making processes related to fraud detection</li>
</ul>
