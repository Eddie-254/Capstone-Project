## 1. Business Understanding
### Overview
The healthcare fraud detection capstone project aims to develop a robust system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks, along with anomaly detection techniques like clustering, outlier detection, and support vector machines. These algorithms will be applied to integrated healthcare data to accurately identify and flag potential fraudulent activities in healthcare claims. 

The project will involve preprocessing and integrating diverse data sources, extracting relevant features, training the models on historical data with known fraudulent and non-fraudulent instances, and optimizing the system for scalability. The interpretability of results will be emphasized to provide transparent and understandable outputs, facilitating decision-making processes. Ultimately, the project seeks to combat healthcare fraud, minimize financial losses, improve patient care, and enhance the integrity of the healthcare industry.
